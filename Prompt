Prompt
Act as a 400 level student in a software engineering course to create a professional command-line application that analyzes application log files and runs inside a Docker container. This is focused on software engineering best practices and containerization. 

Requirements:
1. Log File Processing:
   - Read log files from a specified directory
   - Parse entries in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [LEVEL] message text`
   - Extract log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.) and timestamps
   - Handle multiple log files if present in the directory
2. Summary Report:
   - Count occurrences of each log level
   - Identify time range of logs (earliest and latest timestamp)
   - Display total number of log entries
   - Show the report in a clear, readable format
3. Docker Containerization:
   - Create a Dockerfile that properly containerizes the application
   - Use appropriate base image and best practices
   - Ensure logs can be read from a mounted volume
   - Make the container easy to build and run
4. Code Quality:
   - Write clean, maintainable code with proper error handling
   - Include comments explaining key design decisions
   - Follow language-specific best practices

Focus Areas:
- Demonstrate professional software engineering judgment when reviewing/using AI-generated code
- Apply Docker containerization best practices
- Create maintainable, extensible code that could be used in a real system

Please provide the complete solution with all necessary files and clear instructions for building and running the containerized application.
